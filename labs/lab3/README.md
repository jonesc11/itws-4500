# jonesc11 - Lab 2 - Weather Card - Web Science Systems Development

The purpose of this lab was to set up Git and a bug tracking tool, as well as to get the group development environment setup.

## Individual Lab Objective

* I used an existing GitHub account for this lab, which can be viewed here: https://github.com/jonesc11

* My ITWS-4500 repository is set up to include all of my work for this course. It can be viewed here: https://github.com/jonesc11/itws-4500

* The repository is shared with both Rahul and Professor Fox.

* I installed Bugzilla on my computer. The screenshot of my setup confirmation can be seen in my lab 3 folder named "BugzillaSetup-Confirm-Local.GIF"

## Group Lab Objective

* We used the free tier of AWS as a host for our project. We are running an EC2 instance with Ubuntu 16.04. There are accounts for each group member, and each group member has a virtual host set up for their individual development branches.

* Git is installed on our AWS box as well as on all of our local machines. The GitHub page, including the README and the project proposal, can be found here: https://github.com/jonesc11/mueller-center-class-signups

* Bugzilla is installed on our Ubuntu AWS instance. A screenshot of the setup can be found in my lab 3 submission named "BugzillaSetup-Page-Server.GIF" or you can see it live at http://ec2-34-239-101-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com/bugzilla

* Professor Fox's public key has been added to our AWS instance. The login information is as follows:

Hostname: ec2-34-239-101-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Port: 22
Username: pfox
Password: Password1 (can be changed with "passwd")

Since I do not have Rahul's public key, I cannot add him to the box, but I can add it to the box if he sends it to me.
